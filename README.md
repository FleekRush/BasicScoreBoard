# BasicScoreBoard
This is just an example Scoreboard. Just some packet work, just copy and paste it.

This is a simple Scoreboard, without any features. It should just show, how to make a Scoreboard and how to edit it.
If there are any problems with the code or it doesnt function just comment on this Repository.

Dont do like this is coded by yourself. Thanks.
